# MSP Manager
This repository houses the source for the MSP Manager app hosted on managemsp.nl.

The MSP Manager PWA is a portal where you can import your customer from Microsoft Partnercenter and then open the management portals in the context of the selected customer.
Microsoft provides this functionality in Partnercenter, but i can be slow. That's why I created this app.

You can install the app by going to the [MSP manager website](https://managemsp.nl) in any chromium browser and clicking on the install button in the searchbar.<br/>

You can also use the app in the browser or host it yourself, but by doing that you won't be able to associate .mspcsv files to the app.
